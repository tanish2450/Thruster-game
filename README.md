hello everyone,
i've created this game using chat gpt
i have very minimum knowledge about programming and with that i've overcome many hurdles to create this game
it is a thruster game whose physics is not so good but average 
you should hold both the arrows left and right to move forward either of them to spin
pls email me at tanishr966@gmail.com for ur feedback and ways to improve my game 
mayb we could also collab and make it better
yours sincerely
Tanish Raju
